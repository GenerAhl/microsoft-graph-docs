# Azure Active Directory consent requests

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) consent requests help you manage the request workflow for users attempting to access apps that require admin approval.

To allow users to request access or admin consent for applications they're unauthorized to grant consent to themselves, first enable the consent request workflow. 

>[!NOTE]
>The current APIs are limited to configuring the workflow, reading the list of requests, and denying a request. At this time there arenâ€™t any methods available to approve a request programmatically. However, the contents of the request can be used to recreate a URL which can be used to grant admin consent and approve a request.

The consent request resource types include:

* [adminConsentRequestPolicy](../resources/adminconsentrequestpolicy.md): Specifies the policy by which app consent requests can be created and managed for the entire tenant. There is a single **adminConsentRequestPolicy** per tenant.
* [appConsentRequest](../resources/appconsentrequest.md): A request that represents an aggregation of **userConsentRequests** for a specific application.
* [userConsentRequest](../resources/userconsentrequest.md): A request created by a user to use an app that requires admin consent to access.
* [appConsentRequestScope](../resources/appconsentrequestscope.md): A resource that contains details of the dynamic permission scopes being requested for a given application.  

## Methods

The following table lists the methods that you can use to interact with consent request resources.
